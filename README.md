# pureyaml-withcomments

Yet Another YAML Parser, in pure python ... extended to include
comments as part of the Abstract Syntax Tree, rather than ignoring
them at the lexical tokenizing stage.  This variant of the parser has
been developed for programmers who want to take account -- for
analysis purposes -- of the comments that are included in a YAML file.

The README file documents how to use the extended feature.  For all
other details, refer to the original [README-orig.rst](README-orig)
file.
